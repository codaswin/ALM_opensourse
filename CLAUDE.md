# CLAUDE.md — Project Rules

> Rules Claude Code follows in every conversation on this project.

## Implemented Tech Stack

- **Orchestration:** Custom typed Python agent harness with five specialized runtime agents
- **Inference:** Hosted API (OpenAI/Anthropic/Claude) as primary — self-hosted open model (e.g. Hermes via vLLM/Ollama) as a worker/margin-protection layer for high-volume, low-risk tasks
- **RAG:** FAISS for vector retrieval; optional Knowledge Graph layer (NetworkX for lightweight, Neo4j for production scale) for KG RAG
- **Serving:** FastAPI
- **Persistent memory:** Desktop mode uses app-data SQLite plus per-installation FAISS; server mode uses Postgres, Redis, and per-user FAISS
- **Tracing / LLMOps:** structlog + a lightweight custom tracer (pluggable to Langfuse/Phoenix if the project wants a hosted option)
- **Evals:** pytest-based harness + LLM-as-judge
- **Scheduling:** APScheduler in both modes, with distributed coordination only in server mode
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, embedded in the Tauri desktop shell or served as the web dashboard

**Important distinction:** `agents/` at the project root are the **build-time agents** (Claude Code sub-agents that write code). `backend/app/agents/` are the **runtime agents** — the actual AI agents your product runs in production. Don't conflate them.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Every LLM call goes through the harness's `run_step()` — never call the LLM API directly from a tool or router.** This is what makes tracing, cost tracking, and retries possible.
2. **Harness tool calls are recorded with inputs, outputs, latency, and cost** before the loop continues; direct registry executions emit structured status and latency logs.
3. **Any action tagged `requires_approval` in a tool's schema blocks until a human approves it** — no exceptions, no "just this once."
4. **Context assembly always respects the token budget** — silently exceeding it and truncating mid-response is a defect, not a fallback.
5. **No agent ships without at least one eval suite passing** — a new capability without a golden-set test is not done.

---

## Code Standards

### Python
```python
# Type hints required. Every tool function has a Pydantic schema.
def search_knowledge_base(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[RetrievedChunk]:
    pass

# Async for anything calling an LLM or external API
async def run_step(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    pass
```

---

## Forbidden

- Direct LLM API calls outside the harness/llmops layer
- Tools without a Pydantic input schema
- Silent context truncation — must summarize/compact deliberately (see `skills/CONTEXT.md`)
- Autonomous execution of any `requires_approval` tool
- Storing memory without a `source` and `confidence` field (untraceable memory is a liability)
- Shipping a new agent capability without an eval added to `backend/evals/`
- Hardcoded API keys/model names in code — env vars + `llmops/model_router.py`

---

## Workflow

```
1. Update the relevant current specification or PRP.
2. Implement against the runtime contracts in `backend/app/runtime.py`.
3. Run the validation gates documented in the root README and the applicable PRP.
```

```bash
ruff check backend/ && mypy backend/app --ignore-missing-imports
pytest backend/tests --cov --cov-fail-under=80
pytest backend/evals -v --tb=short          # eval suite — must pass before merge
python -m backend.app.safety.audit          # confirms no ungated risky tools
```
