"""Retry policy per agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md's Error Recovery section.

  ESCALATE_IF:
    - Any requires_approval tool is found executing without a gate (always escalates)
    - Eval suite regresses below the threshold set in INITIAL.md (always escalates)
    - 2 retry attempts failed on a non-safety-critical task

Non-safety-critical failures (LLM API hiccups, tool timeouts, transient
network errors) get up to 2 retry attempts with backoff. Safety-critical
failures must NEVER be auto-retried: retrying could mean re-attempting the
unsafe action itself (e.g. re-issuing a publish that just executed without
its approval gate), so the only correct move is to propagate the failure
immediately so it reaches a human/escalation path, not another attempt.
